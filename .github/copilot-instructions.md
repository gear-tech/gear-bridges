When performing a code review, please audit the smart contract for potential security issues (wrong owners, unauthorized proxy implementation updates and other issues). This contract will be uploaded to mainnet soon and we need to be aware of possible problems. Pay special attention to `./ethereum/test/Base.sol`, which shows an example of deploying smart contracts to production. Analyze any possible security errors/issues we may have based on the state of the contracts in `Base.sol`.
